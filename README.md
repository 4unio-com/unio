# Yunit

This is a fork of Canonical's Unity 8 repository as of April 5, 2017. Following [Mark Shuttleworth's announcement](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/04/05/growing-ubuntu-for-cloud-and-iot-rather-than-phone-and-convergence/)  to abandon Unity 8 development, we are planning to continue working with the project.

Please check [yunit's web site](http://www.yunit.io) (currently under construction) for project updates
 
** See the file CODING for build and running instructions **
